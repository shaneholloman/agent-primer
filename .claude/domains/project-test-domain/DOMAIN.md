# Project Test Domain

This domain lives at the project level (`.claude/domains/`) and should
be discovered as a "local" primitive, distinct from global domains in
`~/.claude/domains/`.

## Key Concepts

- Local domains are project-specific knowledge
- Global domains are shared across all projects
- Both appear in the picker with their source labeled
